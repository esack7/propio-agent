# No Specifications Required

This change involves renaming the application from "ollama-agent" to "propio-agent" without any behavioral modifications.

As documented in the proposal:

- **New Capabilities**: None
- **Modified Capabilities**: None

Since this is purely a naming/branding change that updates package configuration, documentation, and comments without altering any functional requirements, no specification files are needed.

The change affects:

- Package name in package.json
- User-facing documentation
- Code comments referencing the application name

But does NOT affect:

- System behavior
- API contracts
- Provider integrations
- Capability requirements
